Ok, so here's how the .jar-File works.


Just download the .jar, input.txt, and (for now) output.txt- File to the same dir.
Assuming you have java installed, open your command window or terminal.

The basic command, to get this program to work is:

java -jar FindSynonyms.jar $1 $2 $3


$1 is the Path to the input-File
$2 is the Path to the output-File
with $3 you have three options:

1: search with the Google API
2: search with the online Thesaurus-Dic
3: search with both

You won't see any output on the command Line. Just open the output-File with wordpad or notepad++ or something, to view the output.

Example command:

java -jar FindSynonyms.jar input.txt output.txt 3
